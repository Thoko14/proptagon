# PropBase • Grow MVP — Cursor Requirements (No Code)

## 0) Objectives (MVP)
- Enable suburb-first and property-first flows with one properties trigger.
- Keep friction low via default strategy + saved searches.
- Make scope/strategy/search visible & editable from the Grow Top Bar.
- Ensure mobile parity (no hover dependencies for core actions).

## 1) Scope (what changes now)
- Add Grow Top Bar with Search field and chips (Strategy / Search / Location).
- Switch map to hover = outline only, click = opens toolkit (no hover popups).
- Add Primary FAB: “Show Properties Here” (combined suburb/viewport logic).
- Add Secondary FAB: “Layers” (MVP: School catchments).
- Implement Suburb Strategy View as single entry via Strategy chip (“Adjust Strategy…”).
- Implement Suburb List View (ranked by score).
- Implement Property Filter/Strategy View + Saved Search defaults + “Skip filters when default” preference.
- Ensure Properties View shows mini suburb score on cards.
- Implement Compare View (Suburbs | Properties) basic side-by-side.
- Persist user context (strategy, search, location, map bbox).

### Epic A — Grow Top Bar
A1. Top Bar: Search field (location)
- Accept suburb/state/postcode; autocompletion.

## 3) UX Rules
- Defaults first: new users see Balanced Metro strategy.
- One properties trigger via FAB.
- Chips always reflect current state; clickable to change.
- Hover decorative only; click opens panel.
- Mobile parity.

## 4) Data & Calculations
- Suburb score = weighted KPI sum (normalized 0–100).
- Mini suburb score = same as suburb polygon.
- Estimated yield = (annual rent / price) × 100.

## 5) Analytics
Track: strategy_preset_selected, strategy_adjust_opened, strategy_saved, map_show_properties_here_clicked, topbar_location_changed, properties_saved_search_set_default, properties_filters_skipped_via_default, compare_add, layers_toggled, error_occurred, performance_metrics, accessibility_usage, mobile_interaction, search_analytics, real_time_updates, internationalization_usage, security_events, privacy_compliance, watchlist_add, watchlist_remove, alert_created, alert_triggered, search_history_saved, activity_viewed, user_dashboard_accessed.

## 6) QA Checklist
- Top Bar: search, chips, menus correct.
- Map: hover outline only, click opens panel, chip syncs.
